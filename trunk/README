This is seasrvkqd, a SEA protocol server daemon for FreeBSD (non-portable).
The SEA protocol is core of home-made simple LAN Instant Messaging system,
SEA Sender, developed at AVTF Hostel of Tomsk Polytechnic University, Russia.

See http://code.google.com/hosting/search?q=label:SEA-protocol for clients.

The protocol is ugly by design and is not recommended, but this daemon could
serve as a teaching example of using BSD's kqueue()/kevent() facilities in
a real world application, though.

Server has only man page as documentation (see Web for more about the
entire system) and can print a short help if called as: ./seasrvkqd -h

There is also a script to send message from command line, seasend.sh.
It has the only doc printed by -h command line switch.

INSTALLATION:

First, open Makefile and change BINDIR and USER for your system.
Then just run 'make' in this directory to compile.
After that 'make install' will install daemon and rc.d script running
daemon as user you specified.
A 'make uninstall' is also supported.
